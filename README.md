A C++ implementation of the classic Tetris game, built from the ground up with enhancements and additional features. This project stays true to the original while introducing fresh elements to make it remain nostalgic.

## Quick guide
### Compile with:
 `c++ *.cpp -lwinmm`
## Features
- In-Game Sound Effects ðŸ”Š
- Responsive UIðŸ’…: press any key to update the view
- Resumability: Save your progress and continue later! The current map, held Tetromino, and pending Tetrominos are all restored.
All the current map held and pendding tetrominos are retured
- Hold Feature: Store a Tetromino for later use during gameplay.
- See incoming Tetromino
- Easter Egg ðŸ¦†: A spoiler duck randomly spawns on the map. Each hit spoils the current Tetromino, and hitting 5 ducks results in a loss (D-lost!).
- 3 levels (Speed scales with the level/ Hard mode disables the shadow guide for added difficulty)
- Mid-game Pause Menu
- Timer
- leaderboard: Separate leaderboards for each level, sorted by score and time.
- Dynamic dimentions
